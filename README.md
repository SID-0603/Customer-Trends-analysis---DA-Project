## Customer Behaviour Data Analyst Portfolio Project
## Project Overview : End-to-End Corporate Data Analytics Workflow

The primary objective of this project is to build a complete, corporate-grade data analytics pipeline that mirrors how real-world organizations convert raw, unstructured data into meaningful and actionable business intelligence. The workflow spans three major functional areas—data engineering, data analysis, and business intelligence—showcasing a full spectrum of industry-relevant skills.

## 1️⃣ Data Preparation, Modeling & Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)

This phase focuses on transforming raw input data into a clean, structured, and analysis-ready format.

## Key Activities

Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values, identify outliers, correct inconsistencies, and standardize data fields.

Data Transformation:
Encode categorical variables, normalize numerical values, create derived metrics, and restructure the dataset for deeper analysis.

Data Modeling:
Define relationships between tables, create keys, and model the data to align with analytical needs.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Use statistical summaries and visualizations to uncover initial patterns, correlations, and anomalies in the data.

## 2️⃣ Data Analysis Using SQL

In this phase, the project simulates real-world business operations and extracts insights directly from the structured dataset.

## Key Activities

Simulating Business Transactions:
Recreate realistic behaviors such as customer purchases, loyalty interactions, and product-category trends.

Writing Analytical SQL Queries:
Perform aggregations, joins, window functions, and segmentation queries to answer business questions.

## Key Focus Areas

Customer segmentation (e.g., high-value vs. low-value customers)

Loyalty program performance

Purchase behavior and frequency

Sales trends across time and categories

Key revenue drivers and product performance

## 3️⃣ Visualization & Business Insights in Power BI

The final stage translates SQL results into a compelling, stakeholder-ready dashboard.

## Key Activities

Building Interactive Dashboards:
Use Power BI to create visualizations such as bar charts, KPIs, trend lines, heatmaps, and slicers.

Highlighting Strategic Insights:
Expose patterns related to customer loyalty, purchasing behavior, seasonality, and product performance.

Storytelling with Data:
Structure the dashboard to answer key business questions efficiently, enabling leaders to make informed decisions.
